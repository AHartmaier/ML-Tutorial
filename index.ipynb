    "This course provides an introduction into the mechanical properties of composite materials, which are described by three methods: (i) theoretical homogenization methods, (ii) numerical simulations based on the finite element method, and (iii) trained machine learning methods. The aim is to provide insight into the nature of fiber-reinforced composite materials and their properties and to introduce Finite Element Analysis (FEA) as a numerical method for studying mechanical behavior of heterogeneous materials. The pyLabFEA package\n",
    "introduces a simple version of FEA for solid mechanics and elastic-plastic materials, which is fully written in Python. See the [online documentation](https://ahartmaier.github.io/pyLabFEA) of the pyLabFEA package for detailed information.\n",
